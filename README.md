An interactive tutorial on specifying and implementing the simply-typed
lambda calculus in Coq using a locally nameless representation.

This version uses the [Equations](https://github.com/mattam82/Coq-Equations)
Coq package to index the expression type with the number of bound
variables. This definition means that the local closure predicate is not
needed --- instead the type "exp 0" only contains locally closed terms.


INSTALLATION

  This tutorial depends on the `Metalib.Metatheory` library, available from
  [https://github.com/plclub/metalib](https://github.com/plclub/metalib).
  Make sure that you compile and install this library _first_.

  You also need the equations library.

  After you have done that, you can use make to compile the tutorial material
  and generate the documentation.

    `make`             - Compile all Coq files

     Lec2.v            - LN continued: type soundness for STLC
     Lemmas.v          - Auxiliary lemmas about LN, generated by LNgen tool
     Nominal.v         - Definition of STLC using nominal representation,

                         LN substitution-based small-step semantics

Warning: the exercises start simple, but ramp up. The first two exercise files
have significantly simpler exercises than the second two files.
